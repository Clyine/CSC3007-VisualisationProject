# Introduction

Over the past decade, global car production has surged by 52%, predominantly driven by China's growth. In contrast, oil supplies have only increased by 16%. This disparity highlights a significant challenge: the demand for cars is outpacing the available oil supply.

To further illustrate this issue, CrudeOilPeak[^crude_oil_peak], a website that tracks global oil production and consumption, has created a visualization that compares the growth in car production by country/region against the growth in global liquid supplies[^debold_battling_2015] (@fig-on-poster). While the visualization effectively conveys the disparity between car production and oil supply, we believe that it can be improved to be more visually appealing and easier to digest.

# Strengths

# Suggested Improvements

1. *Avoid having two y-axis* as it can be confusing and misleading. Two
different graphs could be created instead.

1. *Too much visual clutter* can make it difficult to interpret the data.

# Implementation


## Data

*   Weekly counts of measles cases by state were obtained from Project
    Tycho.[^panhuis_counts_2018] The data have missing weeks, which were
    treated as zero in @fig-wsj-on-poster, potentially underestimating the
    annual total. Instead, we calculated the weekly mean case count on the
    basis of non-missing data only.
*   Decennial U.S.\ census data for each state.[^stats_state_2023]

## Software

We used the Quarto publication framework and the R programming language, along with the following third-party packages:

*   *readxl* for data import
*   *tidyverse* for data transformation, including *ggplot2* for visualization
    based on the grammar of graphics
*   *knitr* for dynamic document generation
*   *zoo* for interpolating annual population data from the decennial
    U.S.\ census

# Improved Visualization

```{r}
#| label: fig-ggplot
#| fig-cap: "Revised visualization of measles incidence by state of the USA and
#|  year."
#| fig-width: 6.0
#| fig-height: 5.8
#| out-width: 100%

```


# Further Suggestions for Interactivity

Because our visualization was intended for a poster, we did not implement any interactive features, including the infotip. However, if the data are visualized in an HTML document, interactive features can be achieved using the R packages such as *plotly*. In that case, we recommend that the tile does not change its fill color. In contrast, the original visualization changes the fill color of the activated tile to light blue (see @fig-infotip_color_change), which can be misinterpreted as a change in incidence. Instead, we suggest highlighting the activated tile by thickening its border.


# Conclusion

We successfully implemented all suggested improvements for the non-interactive visualization. By labeling every state and choosing a colorblind-friendly palette, the revised plot is more accessible. The logarithmic color scale makes the decrease in incidence after the introduction of the vaccine less striking but enables readers to detect patterns in the low-incidence range more easily.
